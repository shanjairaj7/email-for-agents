**Give your OpenClaw agent its own email address and phone number. Ask it to check email, reply to threads, and send SMS — from WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, or wherever your agent lives.**

## What This Unlocks

| Without Commune | With Commune |
|----------------|-------------|
| Agent can chat | Agent has its own inbox: `assistant@yourdomain.commune.email` |
| No email context | Agent reads, threads, searches your email |
| No SMS | Agent sends/receives SMS from a real phone number |
| One-off messages | Full conversation threading with RFC 5322 compliance |
| No external comms | Agent emails people on your behalf, tracks replies |

## Two Ways to Use

### 1. Personal Assistant

OpenClaw manages your personal email and SMS inbox. You message your agent on WhatsApp, it checks email, replies, sends SMS on your behalf. You're in control — your agent is your proxy.

- "Check my email and tell me what's urgent"
- "Reply to Mom's email and say I'll call Sunday"
- "Text the client that I'm running 10 minutes late"

[Setup guide for personal use →](./use-cases/personal-assistant/README.md)

### 2. Company Agent

OpenClaw handles customer-facing email and SMS. Customers email `support@yourco.com`, OpenClaw triages, drafts replies, escalates urgent issues to Slack, and keeps your team informed — without a human touching the queue first.

- Full inbox triage: classify, prioritize, respond
- SMS escalation to on-call engineers
- Daily digest emails to management

## Skills

This starter includes two OpenClaw skills:

| Skill | What it does | File |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `commune-email` | Send, receive, search, and manage email threads | `skills/commune-email/SKILL.md` |
| `commune-sms` | Send SMS, read conversations, list phone numbers | `skills/commune-sms/SKILL.md` |
| `commune-agent-network` | Agent-to-agent task delegation via email addresses | `skills/commune-agent-network/SKILL.md` |

Each skill includes a companion Node.js CLI helper so your agent can shell out to perform operations without needing to construct raw HTTP requests.

## Installation

**Option 1: ClawHub (one command)**

```bash
clawhub install shanjairaj7/commune
```

This installs all Commune skills — email, SMS, and agent network — directly into your OpenClaw workspace.

**Option 2: Manual install**

```bash
# Clone and copy skills
git clone https://github.com/shanjai-raj/commune-openclaw-email-sms-quickstart
cd commune-openclaw-email-sms-quickstart

cp -r skills/commune-email ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
cp -r skills/commune-sms ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
cp -r skills/commune-agent-network ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

Then talk to your agent:

```
You: Check my email inbox and summarize what's new
Agent: [reads Commune inbox, summarizes threads]

You: Reply to Sarah's email about the contract and say we'll sign next week
Agent: [finds thread, sends reply via Commune]

You: Text +14155551234 that the meeting is moved to 3pm
Agent: [sends SMS via Commune]
```
